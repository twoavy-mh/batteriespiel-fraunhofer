      iron, phosphate) active material. Together with other additives, this material
      is applied to an aluminum current collector.

    m_Localized: The anode is one of the two electrodes of a battery cell. It is
      usually made of graphite (the material from which pencils are made). The hexagonal
      grid structure of the graphite is used to store the lithium ions. The electrons
      emitted by the lithium during the discharge process are fed into the circuit
      via a current collector made of copper foil.

    m_Localized: The cathode is one of the two electrodes of a battery cell. Cathode
      materials are perhaps the most important component of a battery cell. There
      are many different combinations of materials (involving, for example, lithium,
      nickel, cobalt and manganese) that are currently being developed. The cathode
      must be able to store as many lithium ions as possible so that the battery
      can store a lot of energy. The so-called cathode active material is mixed with
      large carbon particles, among other things, and applied to an aluminum foil
      to ensure electron transport.

    m_Localized: During the discharging process, the lithium ions move from the negative
      pole to the positive pole. There, the lithium ions deposit on the cathode by
      absorbing an electron. This generates a current flow (movement of electrons)
      in the circuit. The battery cell is fully discharged when all the movable lithium
      ions have reached the cathode side.

      transition. Since wind and solar energy can only be generated on an irregular
      basis, the energy must be stored. Stationary battery storage systems of very

      space available for these storage systems than for mobile applications, the
